## Technologies

This project was created using React, using Chakra UI components. 


## Description

Hello! This my attempt at the ApTap technical task prior to interviewing for a front-end developer role. 

The template for the task used the Material UI (MUI) component library but I ran into several problem with the source code for this library and was unfortunately unable to use 
any of their components. As such, my UI is slightly different in look and feel to the template. Also, MUI is the only library I found that utilises a persistent Drawer
component. I used the Chakra UI Drawer component which is a little different in functionality and does not have a 'persistent' feature. As such, the user must close the drawer in order to add a new item to their comparison which I recognise is not good UX and something I would fix in future. 

## Future Goals

If I had a little more time on this task, some stretch goals I would attempt are as follows:

* Build my own Drawer component from scratch that persists while still allowing the user the interact with the overlay
* Further styling of the drawer component to make the compared elements a bit neater
* Fix minor bugs with buttons resizing themselves and the remove button on the overlay working intermittently.
